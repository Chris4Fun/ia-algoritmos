## How to run algorithms

### Hill Climbing

Run by executing `HillClimbing.py` in the `src/` directory.

### Genetic Algorithm

Run by executing `Genetic.py` in the `src/` directory.

### Simulated Annealing

Run by executing `SimulatedAnnealing.py` in the `src/` directory.

## Important Clarifications

1. Each algorithm (Hill Climbing, Genetic, and Simulated Annealing) will be executed for all three proposed problems: **N-Queens**, **Traveling Salesman**, and **Scheduling**.
2. Parameter values for each case and the function calls for execution are set at the end of each algorithm file.
